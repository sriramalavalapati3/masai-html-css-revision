<!-- 
In the above debugging example, the form structure is debuuged what are issues
1.for username label it is given Name as attribute instead of for
2.in username input for name attribute username is not closed with a closing quote
because that causes HTML parsing errors if left unclosed.
3.Typo: typ should be corrected to type for proper attribute recognition.
4.we are not supposed to use Submit inside the tag is invalid instead we have to use type="submit", closing tag misspelled (</buttn> âž” </button>).
